Add a check on the clients - check that client UI is listening
This should be reported back to the server

in Server.js add another state (isClientActive) - isClientUiAvailable?
clientOn && uiAvailable?
2params?

We might need to write another timer to check for available clients and if their client UI is available
this info should get reflected in server.experimentsList

we want the bg process running on server, and a socket that sends messages to admin saying this is the latest exp listening



Show parameters of a box. 

ui show result of last action 

no updates on page to show werver is working. 




Should you be able to start more tah one experiment. ??

Check what happens running muiltiple experimets one after another

what happens if running multiple sessions



Work on showing current experiment 
    what to do when it finishes


Export direct to Access 
create sql scripts to summarise client data


Show last experiment 
Test suite for testing experiments
 
Clean up the server request for new session to not include sessionVariables from original config file

BUG:

Stop on admin page causes multiple clients to be created in the experiment session
